# WindowMakerPrank
This program is designed to troll whoever runs it by quickly opening and closing many windows,
 which do not terminate when a single window is closed. To end the program once it has been run, a person would
 need to use a system tool to manually end the task.

Ideally this program would be exported into a .jar file and given a seemingly innocuous name, such as
 Minecraft.jar, to entice an unknowing victim to run the program. Or just added to list of things to
 execute on system startup.
